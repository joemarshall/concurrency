Concurrent Programming Demo Lecture Code
----------------------------------------

This code should work on Windows systems with mingw c++ compiler. 

It could easily be changed to work on other compilers, the simd and threading stuff
varies on different OSes.

I tested with pocketcpp https://github.com/dacap/pocketcpp
